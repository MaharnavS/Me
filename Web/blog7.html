			<h1 class="heading">Analysis of the 42nd Amendment (1976) to the Indian Constitution, the Mini-Constitution</h1>
			<div class="container">
				<h1 class="content">
					Amending a Constitution is modifying or appending a country's Constitution. The methodology is regarded as one of the most thought of and exhaustively debated. As there is a clause to allow for such modifications, in the form of Article 368, Part XX of the Constitution of India, there are clauses to prevent abuse and enforce a systematic schema to prevent misadventures. Nevertheless, in India's post-independence history, we see many cases where the Constitution was amended just for its sake. They were attempts to forcefully carve the flow of power from one State machinery to another, as seemed desirable by few with absolute power or as an attempt to seek absolute power.
					<br><br>
					The First Amendment to the Constitution in 1951, enacted as the Constitution (First Amendment) Act 1951 by the Nehruvian Government, raised some concerns. Many believed this Amendment was a power grab for the legislature and would start a chain reaction leading governments to bend the Constitution at their will. In the following essay, we discuss one such Amendment, the 42nd Amendment, which was an attempt to bend the Constitution and other State machinery according to the will of the then Government, headed by Indira Gandhi as the Prime Minister. In the words of Admin (2019), "She changed the Constitution to such an extent that the 'Constitution of India' was started being called as 'Constitution of Indira'." (para 2); this was the impact the Amendment had on the Constitution. 
					<br><br>
					This essay discusses some of the significant amendments to the Constitution of India under the 42nd Amendment, detailing an analysis of the then situation of the State. We state some amendments in their original form and then dissect different aspects, pros and cons. Nevertheless, we first need to understand the turn of events before the said Amendment. 
					<br><br>
					The Amendment was brought about nearly a decade after Nehru's death, but the storm had been brewing for much longer. As soon as the Constitution was adopted, Nehru found that the Judiciary's interpretation of the Constitution and dearness for the fundamental rights was a significant hurdle in the socio-economic reforms Congress had promised. He forced the Constitution to undergo many Amendments but failed to transform India's socio-economic landscape as he desired. After he died in 1964, Indira Gandhi succeeded him as the Prime Minister of India in 1966. Even under Indira, the Congress Government faced similar hurdles as those faced by the Nehruvian Government. 
					<br><br>
					Following this, under Indira Gandhi as the Prime Minister was set up a committee in 1976 under the Chairmanship of the then Minister of External Affairs Swaran Singh, which is stated by Laxmikanth (2020) as follows:
					<br>
					A document titled 'A Fresh Look at Our Constitution – Some Suggestions' surfaced at this time and was circulated but, after the recommendations contained in it had drawn stringent criticism from diverse quarters, it was not pursued. Amidst tenacious advocacy about the need for constitutional change, particularly after the Kamagata Maru Session of the Indian National Congress, the then Congress President, D.K. Borooah appointed, on 26 February 1976, a Committee "to study the question of amendment of the Constitution.... in the light of experience." The twelve-member Committee, headed by Sardar Swaran Singh, submitted 'tentative proposals' to the Congress President in April 1976 (pp. 1303-1304)
					<br><br>
					These recommendations by the Swaran Singh Committee were brought into action by the 42nd Amendment, even though the then Chairman of the Law Commission of India, Justice P.B. Gajendragadkar, advised against it. These recommendations were to almost all sections of the existing Constitution, and in such detail, a mistake learned from the Nehruvian Government. Along with the above and considering the change to the Preamble, it was worthy of being called the 'Mini-Constitution'. 
					<br><br>
					The 42nd Amendment starts with a lengthy 'Statement of Reasons and Objectives' section, which seems void and redundant after a glance. It starts with a sympathy phrase for the poor and disadvantaged by stating the delay in socio-economic reforms. Then, after a bland defence for the existing institutions provided under the Constitution, it attacks them for being too involved in promoting their selfish ends. It argues that the institutions need to change to bring the ideals of socialism, secularism and national integrity into play, specifically focusing on the Judiciary. It further pleas for showing precedence to the Directive Principles over the Fundamental Rights to smoothen out the socio-economic agenda of the Congress, reiterating that the current setup 'frustrates' the reforms. This forced argument clearly shows the desperation among Congress leaders.
					<br><br>
					It tries to assert the need for a special section for the fundamental duties of a citizen, as under section 51A, and, in a not-so-unexpected situation, special provisions for activities that the then Government defined as anti-national in superfluous terms. These provisions give the Government immense powers to dismiss anybody or anything as anti-national, further strengthening the article 368 along with cutting off the High Courts from decisions on laws to reduce the multiplicity of proceedings under Article 32 and Article 131, specifying a minimum number of judges required to be on the bench for determining the questions as to the constitutionality of laws, as under section 144A. The introduction of a compulsive two-thirds majority for the law to be dismissed was also put forward. These proposals clearly showed the frustration among Congress with different State Courts interpreting the laws differently. The alignment of Congress on the idea of the Supreme Court deciding upon the Constitutional legality of the laws might root in the shortcomings of the First Constitutional Amendment, where Nehru was criticised for not appealing to the Supreme Court and defaming High Courts.
					<br><br>
					Even the Preamble was not spared from the inking of the 'mini-Constitution'. The phrases 'SOVEREIGN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC' and 'unity of the Nation' were replaced with the phrases 'SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC' and 'unity and integrity of the Nation' respectively. The Socialist ideologies of Marx influenced many in the Congress, including but not limited to Nehru. They wanted to bring up rapid growth following five-year plans as the Socialist order in Russia had successfully demonstrated, but the reform methods were radical. Thus the Preamble was to be the mask worn and the sword wielded in support of the reforms. 
					<br><br>
					The addition of clauses under Section 31 and Section 32 enabled the saving of laws concerning anti-national activities, notwithstanding anything contained in Article 13. These clauses removed constraints of the Constitution and gave powers specifically to the Parliament instead of the legislature as a State body, and revoked the Judiciary's power to assess the Constitutional validity of any State Law until unless Constitutional validity of a Central Law is also involved which landed a significant blow to the Federal form of the Indian Government. 
					<br><br>
					Nevertheless, not all Amendments changed India's political and social face; some Amendments laid the foundation for many policies in effect even today. Article 43 was amended to allow for workers to be included in the management process of industries. Article 48 was amended to focus on protecting the environment and sustainable development, which follows Indira's speech at the First UN Conference on Human Environment on 14 June 1972, sketching India as one of the leaders driving sustainable development in the World. Amendment of Article 103 forced the President to consult the Election Commission before dismissing a member of the House found guilty of corrupt practice at an Election to a House of Parliament.
					<br><br>
					As Brass (2001) describes, in the end, the Amendment allowed Congress to implement a 20-point economic reform program that resulted in a considerable increase in economic growth, which was further aided by the non-existence of strikes and protests from trade unions. Brass (2001) continues that encouraged by these developments and false information from party members, Indira called for the conduct of Elections, which she lost to the Janata Party, marking an end of the 42nd Amendment (pp. 40-50).
