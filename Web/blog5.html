			<h1 class="heading">Analysis of the Swadeshi movement as depicted in the novel The Home and The World by Rabindranath Tagore</h1>

				<h1 class="content">
					The Swadeshi movement was a significant part of the Indian independence struggle and helped sow the seeds of Indian nationalism. Owing to its importance, in this write-up, we shall discuss what sparked the Swadeshi movement, what happened and how different sets of individuals and groups recognised themselves as part of the movement. We start by discussing the root cause of the movement, the partition of Bengal in 1905. Thereby we continue with a discussion of prominent events and how they were linked to the demands and goals of different people. Finally, we try to correlate this with the understanding of the novel The Home and the World (1919), considered a firsthand experience of the Swadeshi movement by Rabindranath Tagore. Using the characters portrayed in the novel, we discover how different individuals felt about the movement and how they thought of themselves as a part of it.
					<br><br>
					Bengal being a significant province in British India, the Indian National Movement began in Bengal. Thus, in December 1903, the British government announced the decision to partition Bengal (IndiaToday.in, 2015). The partition was based on areas comprising people following the same religion and caused great unrest among people (Wikimedia Foundation, 2022). Out of this, on August 7, 1905, in Bengal, was born the Swadeshi movement. Adding fuel to this, the conservative policies by then Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon, and the economic miseries of the 1890s made clear the exploitive nature of the British government (Drishti IAS, 2021).
					<br><br>
					Initially, the Swadeshi movement targeted curbing foreign goods; many favoured expanding the Swadeshi movement outside of Bengal and including other foreign services. However, the INC (Indian National Congress), dominated by the moderates, was unwilling. Nevertheless, radical nationalists like Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Bipin Chandra Pal, collectively known as Lal-Bal-Pal, were able to influence others and took extreme forms of boycott. They called for boycotting English education and English jobs as well. By 1909, the Swadeshi movement had spread across the whole nation like wildfire and mass protests happened by burning foreign clothes in huge bonfires and attacks on government schools and institutions.
					<br><br>
					These burnings led to the establishment of many Indian factories like swadeshi textile mills, soap and match factories, tanneries, banks, insurance companies, and shops and revived old industries like Indian Cottage Industry (Drishti IAS, 2021). However, as (Drishti IAS, 2021) states, "The Swadeshi movement also led to social boycott of not only buyers but also sellers of foreign goods" (para 8); it also met opposition from those who had to suffer losses and violent repression from the British government. There were many internal conflicts among leaders on if and how to compensate for these losses. All this rendered the movement leaderless, and the movement subsided by 1908.
					<br><br>
					It served its purpose well for those who started it but failed to unite every category of the Indian population. Instead, the extremists forced the adoption of swadeshi, which had adverse effects and led to internal conflicts. According to Mane (2018), it made the Indian merchants rich and happy but failed to reach the peasantry as they could not afford to boycott cheap foreign goods and adopt expensive yet fragile Indian textiles. Even among those who could afford the cloth, it was not as refined as it used to be as the weaver had to meet a sudden increase in demand, and British oppression had rendered their skills dormant. It angered those who opposed the movement as religious leaders declared those using foreign products unholy and refused to carry out religious processions in their houses. Even students and workers went back to British schools and offices as there were no Indian offices and few Indian schools set up were not at par with English education. Students were also afraid of getting expelled from schools and barred from white-collar jobs.
					<br><br>
					Having discussed the whys and whats of the Swadeshi movement, let us trace back our steps and contrast the above discussion with understanding from the book The Home and the World (1919). We see a portrayal of four types of people affected by the Swadeshi movement. In the book, Sandip is portrayed as a radical extremist willing to commit any sin in the name of his mother country, India. In contrast, Nikhil is portrayed as a moderate who does not take rash decisions. Bimala is portrayed as someone who has been patronised as the incarnation of the mother country. Amulya is someone who blindly follows the torchbearers.
					<br><br>
					Sandip, with a radical mind, displays a zeal for violent and rash protests against foreign goods. He believes that sins like stealing are good in the name of the mother country, and men should snatch what they desire. He desires that every merchant only deals in Indian made goods and threatens them to join the swadeshi movement by burning their stock of foreign goods. This belief is proved by incidents such as burning the boat belonging to Mirjan. He is the least affected by the cons of the Swadeshi movement and pushes hard for a nationwide protest. He believes himself to be the nation's hero who has been bestowed upon the job of making everyone reason with the Swadeshi movement, either by hook or crook.
					<br><br>
					On the other hand, Nikhil avoids making hasty decisions and believes in people's choice to be with or against the Swadeshi movement. He is of the modest belief that he has to do whatever he can do in his power to support the Swadeshi movement but never force someone else to yield. In front of the M.A. students, he tries to justify his contributions to the Swadeshi movement as he says that "I that have imported Indian mill-made yarn and kept it for sale in my Suskar market, and also sent bales of it to markets belonging to neighbouring zamindars." (Tagore, 2002, p. 102). However, later, he argues that he cannot force others to buy it, again showing his modest approach toward Swadeshi.
					<br><br>
					Bimala is portrayed as a gullible person whom Sandip easily patronises into thinking that she is a woman who has a fire inside her, which gives her worshippers power to fight and fall for the nation and is the incarnation of the mother nation. She thinks of Sandip as a true hero and despises her husband. Nevertheless, later she realises this is a mistake and retaliates. She even corrects Amulya into returning the stolen money and makes Sandip return the money he lustfully took from her and never used for the nation.
					<br><br>
					Amulya is an ordinary boy who believes those who preaches the mother nation as a goddess. Initially, he follows Sandip as a shadow follows one's material self, believing him to be a true worshipper of the goddess. This nature of his shows how the uneducated and unaware commoners could get mesmerised by the sugar-coated words of nationalists. Later, he despises Sandip and vows to do whatever Bimala commands, again showing his tendency to follow someone of authority blindly. He states, "I will stake my life for whatever duty you may lay on me, sister" (Tagore, 2002, p. 160).
					<br><br>
					Although the movement failed to make India self-reliant and independent, by 1910, it had sparked many other secret committees based on similar principles and, during the late 1910s, led to successful Gandhian movements. We finally conclude by stating that the Swadeshi movement affected people of the different categories differently. Some felt it an integral part of their struggle, whereas some thought of it as a contribution. Someone followed the torchbearers without thinking of the consequences, and some retreated after facing them.
