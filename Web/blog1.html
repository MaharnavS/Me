			<h1 class="heading">Review of Jules Verne's novel 'Around The World In Eighty Days' based on ideas of space and time</h1>
			<div class="container">
				<h1 class="content">
					The Book 'Around The World In 80 Days' by Jules Verne remains one of the best novels in the sci-fi genre. It makes a mathematical Englishmen, as opposed to his taste, travel worldwide for 80 days. This idea seemed outlandish and impossible to complete using the then-available means of transport like steamers and coal-powered trains. Nevertheless, the protagonist embarks upon this adventure and goes even to the length of wagering twenty thousand pounds. Even after facing multiple obstacles and putting his life on the stack, he completed the journey in seventy-nine days instead of eighty. It single-handily portrays multiple socio and economic conditions of the colonial world, especially understanding of space and time in the society during the late 19th century. Thus, in this write-up, we confine our interests and discussions to matters of space and time.
					<br><br>
					We start with an introduction to 19th century London which was considered the most advanced city of its time and had the sense of space and time being numbers and thus inter-relatable, yet being inaccurate in the matter of measuring them. Verne conveys this through multiple incidents. As he describes the state of the Mansion, Verne (2018) says, "he was steadily watching a complicated clock which indicated the hours, the minutes, the seconds, the days, the months, and the years." (p. 12) and "on the mantel stood an electric clock, precisely like that in Mr. Fogg's bedchambers, both beating the same second at the same instant." (pp. 17-18) which tells how much accuracy of time mattered for Mr Fogg but at the same time Verne (2018) says, "You are four minutes too slow. No matter; it's enough to mention the error." (p. 14) which contrasts Mr Fogg's accuracy and brings forward the lack of means of keeping very accurate times among the commoners.
					<br><br>
					Discussing accuracy in time and clocks' ability to maintain accuracy without talking about the concept of correcting one's clock when travelling according to a shift in longitude seems incomplete. We see two incidents where Passepartout is asked to correct his clock according to changing longitude. However, he refuses to do so, stating, (Verne, 2018) "My watch? A family watch, monsieur, which has come down from my great-grandfather! It doesn't vary five minutes in the year. It's a perfect chronometer, look you." (p. 49) which is seen as childish. In the first incident at Suez, he was asked to correct his watch by adding two hours and in the second by adding five hours. Passepartout, a commoner, could not wrap around his head the disorienting concept of the shift in longitude while travelling around the world.
					<br><br>
					(Verne, 2018) "You have made a mistake of one day! We arrived twenty-four hours ahead of time; but there are only ten minutes left!" (p. 270). Although we ridicule Passepartout for not correcting his watch but later we see how Mr Fogg's journey easterward made him gain a day at the rate of 4 minutes per degree, (Verne, 2018) "In journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun, and the days therefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed degrees in this direction." (p. 271), and thus made him think that he arrived in eighty days instead of seventy-nine days. He was unheard of this fact because he had seen the meridian pass eighty times, and his friends in London had seen it seventy-nine times.
					<br><br>
					We see a great understanding of space as mere numbers and thus interchangeable among different units when Verne (2018) says, "at half-past eleven, having put his right foot before his left foot five hundred and seventy-five times, and his left foot before his right five hundred and seventy-times, reached the Reform Club". This remark means that he accurately measured the distance between the Club and the Mansion and had thus calculated the number of steps he would have to take, converting the distance into his step length. In further chapters, we see Mr Fogg correct a native of Hong Kong when he foolishly states the distance between Hong Kong and Yokohama as sixteen hundred and sixty miles instead of the exact sixteen hundred. Further remark (Verne, 2018) "It's the same thing." (p. 141) by the native conveys to us the lack of importance of exact measures of space among the commoners.
					<br><br>
					The above incidents also prompt us to discuss the sheer accuracy with which they knew the distance between two locations. In multiple instances, the author mentions the exact distance by each sea and land. Mr Fogg uses this information to calculate the expected time to reach the destination and avoid sudden realisations. The author also mentions the difference between aerial distance and road distance between Bombay and Calcutta, hinting toward the conduction of surveys calculating exact distances, (Verne, 2018) "The distance between Bombay and Calcutta, as the bird flies, is only from one thousand to eleven hundred miles; but the deflections of the road increase this distance by more than a third." (p. 60). He takes these surveys to another level by mentioning the exact land area of India (Verne, 2018) "which is called India, embraces fourteen hundred thousand square miles" (p. 59) and area controlled by Britain (Verne, 2018) "But British India, properly so-called, only embraces seven hundred thousand square miles" (p. 59). All this tells us about the advancements in measuring techniques, such as the ongoing 'Great Trigonometrical Survey'.
					<br><br>
					Thus from the above discussion, we see that this sci-fi is different from others because it reflects something which seemed very possible in the 19th and 20th centuries. It does not base itself of-off something which seems absurd and childish. We see the author hinting towards the development of time and space and increasing understanding of it as numbers and some places that still refer to them abstractly. For them, some inaccuracies are inevitable. We also see concepts like longitudes and central time zones followed by the whole country for the interests of trade and travel.
