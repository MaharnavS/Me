			<h1 class="heading">Analysing why Michael Mann writes that India was a laboratory for British science and technology</h1>

					We see the British implement many policies and undertake multiple projects throughout history. All these were ‘experiments’ done by the British in the colonies to analyse outcomes and thus improvise and implement the same in their homeland, i.e., Britain and in some cases, in other colonies as well. We shall see how these experiments affected people’s lives in the colonies, briefing over the pros and cons. We try to gather experiments from a broad set of aspects of one’s social and personal life, forming education, caste, census, religion and travel. The British were known to colonise, experiment and learn. The British were keen on studying the various aspects of the colonies and thus undertook various surveys. These surveys generated massive amounts of data, which the British further used to form policies for the colony and other parts of British territory. These policies, surveys, and big projects were part of the British zeal to experiment, as we will see later. These experimentations effectively turned the colonies into their laboratories.
					<br><br>
					Being first on our list, we start with British experiments with education. Initially, the British did not have much control over the education system in India. According to Mann (2014), “In the eighteenth century, India’s education system was divided into two levels. At the primary education level were the local elementary institutions such as the pathshalas and maktabs. At the higher education level were the tols and madrassas.” (p. 316). Initially, the EIC (East India Company) funded these state-run universities and gradually tried to standardise the curriculum; however, the education content was left untouched as that needed immense labour in the form of translators, interpreters and administrators.
					<br><br>
					The independence of educational institutions did not continue for long as by the 19th century, the British had gained judicial and administrative powers, and the language used in these places needed to be standardised. “Thomas B. Macaulay (1800–59), completed a dossier on Indian history, culture, literature and languages. He came to the conclusion that the entire literature in Sanskrit and Persian was not comparable to a single bookshelf of European literature” (Mann, 2014, p. 316); this statement by Macaulay gave the British an excuse to ‘modernise’ the Indian education system by introducing English language and English education and train the ‘ideal’ Indian elite but finally had to retreat.
					<br><br>
					This experiment helped introduce modern sciences into the Indian education system and abolish traditional learnings. Many universities were set up, which inspired many others. These reforms in the educational system helped India modernise and push itself forward in science and technology. Nevertheless, in the process of modernisation, India lost its heritage. We no longer follow the gurukul style of learning, which worked on the overall development of students. Students in the present age lack social skills, good health, and spiritual understanding.
					<br><br>
					The British tried to segregate curriculum based on caste, and thus they undertook the massive project of documenting everyone. The process of surveying for the purpose mentioned above was called a census. Initially, the British tried to segregate people based on what they understood to be their caste, but this posed multiple challenges as not everyone had a similar understanding of what caste is. Samarendra (n.d.) mentions that the surveyors found out that they encountered local jatis instead of the fourfold varna division. These observations from the initial surveys made them redefine what they understood by caste and thus what we understand today.
					<br><br>
					This experiment of the British was so helpful in mapping the ethnographic nature of the nation that we still conduct the census and include questions about caste. The results of this survey have helped the Indian government a great lot in informing policies. The smaller surveys trying to define caste also helped us form the modern definition of caste. Nevertheless, this remains the biggest con, we permanently ‘defined’ caste instead of abolishing the practice of caste-based division. In ‘defining’ caste, we have ignored the fluid boundaries of the divisions which prevailed in the olden times. Such fluid boundaries and definitions allowed people to define themselves in whatever way they seemed to fit freely. The current concept of caste makes the people bound by a public image that may not seem fit or may not portray who they are. Freely available knowledge about the caste distribution in India has also led to politicians targeting a specific caste in their propaganda. This caste oriented approach reduces their ability to work for the nation and induces partial policymaking.
					<br><br>
					Lastly, the British also experimented with the laying of a railway network. During the expansion of colonial power in India, the British were only concerned with moving military and resources, but later they tried to experiment with how the Indian masses responded to passenger railways. They laid tracks connecting pilgrims and took permission from the religious institutions to allow the devotees to use motorised transport. The British expected these efforts to meet with massive support from the Indian masses as “The substantial number of pilgrims travelling to Puri, which they estimated to be between five and six hundred thousand annually, would guarantee handsome profits to investors.” (Ahuja, 2004, p. 108). However, this resulted in a faster spreading of diseases from pilgrims. The British also received backlash from those who considered journeys by motorised transport to reduce the benefits of the journey to pilgrims.
					<br><br>
					Even to this day, railways serve as the primary mode of transportation. Millions of devotees visit the pilgrims all year round due to the availability of easy and fast means of transportation. The introduction of these modes of transport has allowed those incapable of foot journeys to show their devotion more often. However, some argue that this led to decreased devotion, and devotees have become tourists. Earlier, faster means of travel were considered a boon as people could be taken away from the unhygienic pilgrims quickly, but soon it was realised that it meant faster spreading of diseases and thus has led to many famines and pandemics. This phenomenon stays true to this day, as we saw with the outbreak of Covid-19.
					<br><br>
					So, the British conducted many experiments in the colonies, out of which we discussed some. We saw how the British used science and technology to implement the policies and conduct surveys, but soon most of them backfired. This cycle of implementation and side effects makes us say that the colonies acted as a laboratory. These experiments also helped us, independent India, learn along with the British. We got railways, the census concept, and a solid educational system, among others. Nevertheless, as the cycle went on, we also had to face some cons, some of which taught us lessons and made us think about ways to avoid them, like classifying multiple jatis into a more extensive set, and some of which, to this date haunt us, like controlling the spread of diseases and reviving traditional forms of knowledge.
