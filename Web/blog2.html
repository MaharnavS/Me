			<h1 class="heading">Development of Universal Suffrage over 200 years from 1789-1989</h1>

					Suppose we dig deeper into the evolution of the term Universal suffrage. In that case, we find that Virginia was the first in the 17th century to give voting rights to all free men irrespective of their property. Nevertheless, even it had to later withdraw to the laws of England as other colonial governments had done. The word Universal suffrage came into existence per the definition prevalent during the 17th and 18th centuries (this finding is discussed later concerning struggles in America in para 3) on July 8, 1776, in Pennsylvania, when, for the first time, the democratisation of the electorate was experienced, which permanently expanded the meaning of suffrage (McCURDY, 2008). Even though the Pennsylvania Constitution granted suffrage to any man who paid taxes, these were radical ideas two hundred centuries ago. This right laid the stepping stone for what we think of Universal suffrage today and will consider in the future.
					<br><br>
					In simple terms, suffrage is the right to vote, also known as franchise. Adding the word 'Universal' extends its definition to mean the right to vote to all adults irrespective of their social or economic status, background, race, disability, or any other differentiating factor. This word has just a simple definition when written in words. However, it means a lot when we read about the history related to it and the struggles people mounted against their oppressors to gain Universal Franchise. Below, we will try to brief about the same history and talk about the same struggles in context with gender and race, which may also extend into class territories.
					<br><br>
					Nevertheless, even before we begin with our discussion, we find the inclusion of gender in the very term used to describe equal rights to vote. During the 19th century, Universal suffrage was used synonymously for Universal manhood suffrage, which was later extended during the women's suffrage movement in New Zealand (Roberts, 1993, p. 1). Some even argue that the restriction of suffrage to people above a fixed age or not allowing insane people to vote is a violation of Universal suffrage. However, this article does not aim to conclude that. Instead, we start by discussing how race and gender played essential roles in struggles mounted based on each other in the struggle for woman suffrage in the Americas.
					<br><br>
					The struggle for Woman Suffrage in the Americas is a fine example of understanding how race, class and gender get incorporated into suffrage movements, which had a peculiar correlation with the anti-racist movements, and by extension, the Black Suffrage movement going on at the time. As Nelson (1979) states, "What starts out looking like a truly radical project can quickly become bound and ghettoised by the barriers of class, sex and race." the Women Suffrage movements were quickly considered racist, while they considered the anti-racist movements be sexist. While there was no notion of 'no vote' for women, there was not any to allow the same; granted later by the 19th Amendment in 1920 is owed to Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who first introduced the notion of women's suffrage at the first Women's Rights Convention in Seneca Falls in 1848 (Nelson, 1979).
					<br><br>
					While Elizabeth was dismissed at the first Convention and her views were considered too radical, the Women's Rights Convention, comprised of the supporters of the Abolitionist movement, was later split over this. The ones who supported women's suffrage further got split into National Woman Suffrage Association and American Suffrage Association. This split is what sews the relation between Woman Suffrage and Race. The American Suffrage Association preferred voting rights for Blacks above voting rights for Women and called the National racist. In contrast, the National Woman Suffrage Association was predominantly feminist, preferred Woman Suffrage, did not allow men to hold chairs, gave way to the 16th Amendment in the Constitution for Woman Suffrage, and termed the American as sexist.
					<br><br>
					By the 20th century, a radical movement was formed that sought to push for a federal amendment, once again raising the racial issue. However, it aligned with the interests of a Northern Black middle-class movement and a militant working women's movement, giving them a much broader and progressive base (Nelson, 1979). This merger happened during a rapid reorganisation of American society, which incorporated the Woman Suffrage movement with the Labor Movement. The Labor Movement shifted the focus on class as all the working-class women started thinking that worker protection could be legislated and thus demanded representation. The demand for woman's suffrage was included in the demands of the Labor Movement.
					<br><br>
					Nevertheless, the race aspect never eroded. The Blacks in the South thought of fighting for woman suffrage as a way to fight racist laws. Even liberal middle-class men and women began speaking against racial violence. Ultimately, it united those who strongly advocated women's suffrage (Nelson, 1979). According to the August 2012 issue of the Crisis, Negroes had a more significant proportion of women, whose votes would increase the voting importance in the North. Black middle-class, educated women began organising clubs, a particular example of the National Association of Colored Women in 1896, which endorsed woman's suffrage. One of the activists for woman suffrage, Ida Wells Barnett, went as far as to link control of racial violence with suffrage. Thus according to Nelson (1979), "A new direction for the suffrage movement grew out of this strong infusion of working class women, of middle class Black people, and of a new breed of middle class white women; educated, restless and idealistic".
					<br><br>
					The incidents on March 3, 1913, in Washington, DC, demonstrate how even after being on the same side of one cause, i.e. Universal suffrage, the people were divided based on race and gender. As Nelson (1979) states, "Black women marched in that parade, though not without raising racist reaction from some of the white women organizers", along with:
					<br>
					white men surged into the streets ... pushing women down,
					stabbing cigars at them ... parade was a turning point that
					radicalized many women, stirring a new consciousness of the
					depths of male hatred and of women's oppression.
					<br>
					Finally, in 1917, National Woman's Party was formed, which forced the 19th Amendment in 1919, ratified by the states in 1920.
