			<h1 class="heading">Indian Foreign Policy: How It Went From Being a Pseudo Policy to Being Extremely Rigorous</h1>
			<div class="container">
				<h1 class="content">
					Why Pseudo?
					<br><br>
					After its independence, India was considered a great power and expected to shoulder the burden of global responsibilities. Still, it had a fundamentally lacking foreign policy, if we could say it had one. India had been dealing with foreign matters on a case-by-case basis and never focused on making a foreign policy adapted to the shifting global balance of power. It was true that India was a great power. It had become a centre of admiration in the modern global economy, was one of the fastest-growing economies, and gained the status of a nuclear weapon state. Nevertheless, it did not behave like one. Not going to the event by Gandhi Peace Foundation and the inability to intervene during China's crackdown on Tibetan Protest was seen as a crisis in Indian Foreign Policy.
					<br><br>
					As soon as Jawaharlal Nehru became the first Prime Minister of independent India, the ongoing partition and riots over Kashmir withdrew his attention. Due to constitutional and moral constraints, India was never comfortable using 'hard power'. Thus, it relied on its global political superiority over Pakistan to deal with the issues. Nevertheless, this did not come out to be very handy as it realised it had lost its conventional superiority over Pakistan after the Mumbai attack. This loss was a surprise for India as it was undertaking a defence modernisation programme worth 50 Billion USD which would render it a global military might. India's handling of foreign situations proved weak and ineffective, thus forcing it into action.
					<br><br>
					The non-alignment Movement can be considered to be the beginning of India's first complete foreign policy. The Non-alignment Movement was started when newly decolonised nations that did not want to join either of the military blocs got together to assert their autonomy, plea for disarmament, and more significant development aid. However, this could not fill the gaps in India's foreign policy, as Pant (2016) points out that "India's rhetoric about solidarity with the Third World was largely a function of India's limited capabilities and commensurate interests.". Throughout the Cold War, India's non-aligned foreign policy posture preserved Indian autonomy. However, strategies against China and Pakistan were not very evident, and the limitations of the Non-alignment Movement were clear after India's defeat in the 1962 war.
					<br><br>
					What Happened?
					<br><br>
					Even after the defeat in the 1962 war and the blow to Non-alignment Policies, there was no significant change. Further down the road, it was the year of 1971, when India was forced to take up arms against Pakistan over Bangladesh, which forced India into action. Pakistan had always maintained close relationships with the United States. The United States stationed one of its fleets, USS Enterprise, in the Bay of Bengal to intimidate India and it was clear that the United States will go against India to support Pakistan. This threat forced the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to align with the Soviet Union to carry out her war without intervention from the United States. From this war was born Bangladesh which unexpectedly, was proven to ally with Pakistan and China against India’s central position in Asia. The war, however drastically improved relations with the Soviet Union, albeit to such an extent that it didn’t even dare to criticize Soviet Union’s misadventures in Afghanistan.
					<br><br>
					The question of nuclear weapons was also raised as China had conducted its first successful nuclear test in 1964, which came just after the defeat in 1962. Indian policymakers sensed the urgency and sought a nuclear umbrella from the West, but were refused support. This forced India to turn to indigenously developed nuclear weapons. In 1974, India conducted its first nuclear test in Pokhran and termed it a Peaceful Nuclear Explosion to escape international authorities. Nevertheless, the explosion led to immediate sanctions imposed by the international community, with a heavy dent in its economy. India’s resistance to the Non- Proliferation Treaty further contributed to the sanctions. It had always maintained that the treaty was unfair to those who were not a nuclear power and served special concessions to those who already possessed it.
					<br><br>
					India’s further interactions with its neighbours laid the base for its current Foreign Policy. The economic blockade of Nepal helped in dethroning the monarchy prevalent in Nepal, but India’s intervention in the case of Sri Lanka backfired. India had to suffer the loss of troops, the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi and multiple riots trailing the assassination. Then came the ultimate blow, the collapse of the Soviet Union caused a collapse of the Indian economy. Albeit, Pant (2016) considers it to be a boon as it forced India to move toward economic liberalisation, forced the policy makers to adapt to the new global political and economic realities and led to greater integration into the global economy. At the beginning of the new millennium, due to changes in global power following the demise of the Soviet Union, India is left on the verge of becoming a new major global power, rendering it a major attraction due to rapidly growing economic and military might.
					<br><br>
					What Happened – Lets zoom in
					<br><br>
					The above two sections reason why India’s foreign policy was incomplete and weak until the dawn of the 21st century and lay down the events which led to India being a global might and initiating the inking of an extremely rigorous Foreign Policy. Now, the following subsections describe events that influenced India's policies toward its closest ally and neighbour, Russia and Bangladesh, respectively.
					<br><br>
					<strong>India and Russia</strong>
					<br>
					Even though the global power structure changed drastically after the Cold War, Russia and India have still managed to maintain friction-less relations. During Soviet era, even though India touted itself as the leader of Non-Alignment Movement, it harvest its special relation status with the Soviet Union. For India, Russia proved to be counterbalancing force in facing the international community and helped India strengthen its military and push scientific research. It was Russia who helped India launch its first satellite, Aryabhatta. For the Soviet union, India was a way of counterbalancing Chinese and American influence in the Asian region, and a way of securing support from the Third World nations via Indian leadership of Non-Alignment Movement. During Stalin’s rule, India was preoccupied with domestic matters and was seen as under the influence of the English and Americans. However, India’s position on the Korean conflict saw India and Soviet Union converge in policy and this started converted a symbiosis between the two nations into a long standing alliance.
					<br><br>
					Post-Cold War, Russia had lost its interest in asserting political relationships with South Asia, but maintained South Asia as a potential market for sale of arms and missile technology. Even in India, there was a rapid rise in US investments and trade. Only after Putin came into power, Russia refocussed on India. Under Putin, India and Russia established strategic partnership in 2000. Putin’s re-election in March 2012, furthered the strategic partnership. At one point there were even talks about a strategic triangle between India, China and Russia to better the regional and international stability, however, as either of the three required the United States, the talk did not reach conclusions. India further signed many military deals with Russia, but the rising pressure on India to adjust according to the changing nature of modern warfare, demands India to adapt.
					<br><br>
					<strong>India and Bangladesh</strong>
					<br>
					After war with Pakistan over Bangladesh, Bangladesh was expected to be a permanent ally to India. However, in recent years India has failed to play its part. Bangladesh seeks removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers on Bangladeshi products, but India’s part has prevented any serious progress (Pant, 2016, p. 94). India has also failed to hasten talks on transit rights and water-sharing agreement. Bangladesh has, in recent years, faced political crisis. The boycott of 2010 elections by opposition parties, over removal of caretaker system, has led to erosion of electoral process in the country.
					<br><br>
					According to Pant (2016), Bangladesh was expected to be indebted to India for its role in assisting Bangladesh to achieve independence, but that did not happen. Ironically, Bangladesh and Pakistan, both share the common desire to balance India’s power. In 1974, Pakistan and Bangladesh signed an accord to establish diplomatic relations. Further severing ties with India, Bangladesh and China signed a Defence Cooperation Agreement in 2002.
					<br><br>
					Bangladeshi political parties have, in many ways, defined their foreign policy agenda centred around India. India realised its image being perceived by Bangladesh as that of a supporter of the Bangladesh Awami League, thus, India made some efforts in correcting it (Pant, 2016, p. 97). Nevertheless, it proved to be unfruitful. These events coupled with India’s stand on Bangladesh being an Islamist Fundamentalism has led to trust-deficit relations between the two.
