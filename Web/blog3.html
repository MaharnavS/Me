				<h1 class="content">
					How It Started and Ended
					<br><br>
					The first French revolution began with the Estates-General in 1789. It all began when the Ancien Regime failed to manage the economic instability caused in France. The instability caused economic depression, unemployment and inflation of prices of essential commodities. Even in such trying times, King Louis XVI harshened the taxation policy to regenerate the depleting State coffers and pay the war debts due to Anglo-French War, 1778-1783. The public saw this mismanagement as a sign of weak governance and an unable ruler.
					<br><br>
					Before the revolution, there was a wave of political dissent across Europe, and non-elites, especially the working class Bourgeoisie, started discussing issues of political importance in places like coffeehouses and salons. During Louis XVI, the Court of Versailles was France's cultural, political and intellectual centre of France, but this emergence of the public sphere caused a shift to Paris as the centre (Blanning, 1998, p. 26). This shift made the Court of Versailles ineffective in influencing public opinion.
					<br><br>
					The Elites and the King were permanently exempted from paying the taxes, had about one- third of French land under control and were adequately represented in the court. This unequal say in the court and increasing interests in politics led the Bourgeoisie to demand representation in the court. Louis XVI allowed for the same to cope with the increasing political strain. The middle-class declared themselves the representatives of the public's will, and letters were collected containing the grievances of the lower classes. However, this system did not stay for long as the Third State, comprising the middle-class, was always outvoted by the other two. On 17th June 1789, the Third state formed the National Assembly; on 20th July of the same year, they took the famous 'Tennis Court Oath' to write a constitution for France.
					<br><br>
					France, for some time, formed a Constitutional Monarchy, but over rumours of the French ruler hiring Swiss guards to force the Assembly into submission, crowds of protestors gathered. On 14th July, the crowd stormed the Bastille and captured the king, who was later executed using the Guillotine. This beheading marked the abolition of the Ancien Regime, which many say marked the end of the French Revolution. The later years marked a series of short parliaments, leading Napolean to lead a military coup and install his authoritarianism. He, too, was overthrown during the Battle of Waterloo and replaced by a provisional government, which finally led to the democracy we know today.
					<br><br>
					Historians argue that the beheading of Louis XVI marked the end of the French revolution, but, in this article, we argue that the French revolution continued way beyond that and, in some essence, continues today. A revolution concerning the political landscape of a country can be said to be a radical and sudden change in political power and organisation. If we go by this definition, under Napolean, the political power and organisation changed drastically as it did after his abdication. Thus, one might say that the French revolution ended after the first free elections to the parliament. But again, we can argue that a revolution can also include radical social and technological shifts. Furthermore, developments rooted in the French revolution should be considered a part of the French revolution. This is why the following piece of writing establishes such developments and their roots in the French revolution, hence justifying the title.
					<br><br>
					Fine Art - The Finest Weapon of Propaganda
					<br><br>
					During the French Revolution, many new forms of propaganda were invented while others were mastered. Among them was one that remains the best form of propaganda, art. While during the First French Revolution of 1789, many artists could influence the masses effectively and at scale. The idea of bringing emotions from art turned out to be so effective that even revolutions and governments today use it. Examples include the painting portraying the "Oath of the Tennis Court" and "Liberty Leading the People", showing a woman holding the French flag and the soldier running for their lives at the hands of revolutionaries. Even today, we see protestors using posters and paintings, politicians using slogans, songs and symbols, and journalists using cartoons. And not only today, but even years before French Revolution, the Bourbons used fine art to pursue their subjects. We also see the painting of "Napolean Crossing the Alps" used by the Monarch and his followers to invoke a feeling of safety under his rule and loyalty towards him.
					<br><br>
					Nevertheless, not many discussions have been stirred up on the topic. According to Dowd (1951), there have been significantly fewer systematic discussions about the various aspects of revolutionary propaganda during the revolution (p. 532). Thus, here we discuss the same at lengths permitted by the available resources.
					<br><br>
					In 1789, the revolutionaries were faced with a crisis. They had to re-establish the psychological unity of France on some new basis. (Dowd, 1951, p. 534). They had to choose a medium of propaganda which was cheap and easily accessible as non-Bourgeois were unable to afford books and newspapers due to the still high price of printing. So, they chose music and art; thus, the idea of artists as national propagandists and revolutionists emerged. Even great philosophers of that time, such as Montesquieu, Voltaire, Diderot and Rousseau, emphasised in their writings the political and social significance of arts for the State and the individual.
					<br><br>
					Under the new social order, the artists lost their usual markets with no monarchy. They sought the public to sell their art. In such times as were there during the revolution, propaganda art was their only hope. Even the new State was under dual pressure, from artists to support art as the monarchs had done and help it flourish, and from a political perspective to keep up people's belief in them. The above, combined with the desire of the artists to warmly welcome loyalty to the nation, fueled the development of art to such an extent that everybody then as well as today, gained access to it. Some might have access to monumental museums and art galleries, while others have access to it through the internet or, in those times, through pamphlets and journals.
					<br><br>
					We shall come back to the discussions around pamphlets and journalism in times of the French Revolution but first, let us go a little further in our understanding of the social and psychological state of the art and artists. The artists, especially the younger generation, were much more eager to contribute to the revolution. Many volunteered for military services and political positions, as portrayed in the examples of the National Convention where no less than four artists sat on the bench and during the Reign of Terror when the Mayor of Paris was a sculptor (Dowd, 1951, pp. 536-537).
					<br><br>
					As the revolution advanced, the idea of devotion became more and more linked to death. Many artists started depicting revolutionaries dying for their fatherland (from the French translation of 'Patrie') and maintained that good patriots ought to die protecting it. Many graphic representations of famous characters dying were shown to win the public's sympathy and ignite a sense of revenge. Some artists depicted them in realistic poses, while others depicted them in a symbolistic form. However, in either form, they appealed to the citizens, especially youths, to be a soldier or be a hero. However, according to Dowd (1951), artists like Prud'hon and David combined the two in an artistic synthesis of 'immense power'. Examples include David's 'Assassination of Marat' and 'Death of Le Peletier De Saint- Fargeau'.
					<br><br>
					They contributed to the formation and success of what is said to be the 'French Revolutionary Army'. Even in the contemporary world, we see a similar pattern where art in the forms of cinema, poetry, speeches and digital pictures is used to appeal to the heroism of people. Movies like 'The Hanoi Hilton' and 'In Love and War' were produced during the US-Vietnam war to move the Americans against the Vietnamese and boost military intakes required for the war. The movies even invoked protests by the left-wing to bomb Hanoi and consider Harold Wilson's attempts at peace as a betrayal (Vickers, 2008, pp. 1-3). We also see some recent examples from Hollywood, like 'Uri: The Surgical Strike' released months before the 2019 General Election, which was used as a propaganda film for the election by BJP.
					<br><br>
					Let us reel back to the topic of pamphlets. The success of pamphlets during the French Revolution tends to get little attention; the article is accused of the same. Many dailies supplemented the news and opinions in their papers with pamphlets, one example being the royalist daily 'Ami du Roi'. Chisick (1988) suggests the definition of pamphlets to be as follows: "a brief, self-contained publication directed at a specific issue, or fairly narrow range of issues, which is intended to influence public opinion, and which is produced unofficially" (p. 626). Individuals printed pamphlets to influence opinions much needed to turn sentiment against the Old Regime, as periodicals were closely censored. Even though the pamphlets were occasional and written when some developments happened, they were very influential during the revolution because events happened almost regularly. Pamphlets were seen as part of the public and conveyers of public opinion. Thus, pamphlets still play a role, albeit not often, when the Government does not want to deface its policies as decrees and show public support.
					<br><br>
					'Révolutionner le monde actuel'
					<br><br>
					The French Revolution not only helped us form our Preambles and Constitutions and put words like equality and fraternity in the mouths of revolutionaries all around the globe, but it also revolutionised technology.
					During the French revolution, as Guerlac (1955) best describes:
					<br>
					The most significant period of French scientific leadership coincided with the Age of Revolution, and the time of Mirabeau, Danton, Robespierre, and Bonaparte was also that of Lagrange, Laplace, Monge, Condorcet and many other mathematicians, astronomists and physicists...Laplace read a series of important papers on celestial mechanics; Coulomb presented his sixth memoir on electrostatic experiments with the torsion balance; Lavoisier and Seguin reported on their classic experiments on respiration and heat regulation in man and other animals. (pp. 93-94)
					<br>
					Whether science, war, medicine, food, or even technology for painless and confirmed execution, the French Revolution has influenced the contemporary world.
					<br><br>
					The French were always obsessed with public punishments and beheading machines. Many years before the Guillotine was invented, we see a description of the imaginary beheading machine of similar design to that of a Guillotine in the book Perlesvau, also called Li Hauz Livres du Graal (The High Book of the Grail). Till the invention of the Guillotine, the most common methods of execution were the famous 'hanged, drawn and quartered' and chopping of the head using an axe or sword. Both were extremely painful and caused chaos in public. This dilemma gave way to the invention of the Guillotine. The Guillotine was a high mast machine with a heavy blade hanging on top, which would come down on the accused's neck with increased inertia.
					<br><br>
					The Guillotine captured so much attention from the public that even the prints showing people getting beheaded focused on the machine instead of the person. As IMHOLT (2017) mentions in his article, the Connecticut Journal produced a print of the "Execution of the French King" with a woodcut of the execution of King Louis XVI bordered with decorative skulls and crossbones, where the decoration gave visual prominence, not to the Monarch but the instrument of his death (p. 385). Such an attraction is expected due to the sheer mass and engineering of the Guillotine. However, when revolutionaries are being sentenced to death and artists are portraying death as an honour, it is more than welcome by the public.
					<br><br>
					Even many today choose to die through painless means, and Governments are under more and more pressure to allow so. Following the French Revolution, we now have provisions for lethal injections, which have gained popularity in countries like the United States and China. Nevertheless, today's methods are far from foolproof as the Guillotine once was. Even in India, the topic of capital punishment was taken up by the Law Commission of India suo moto, which in its Law Commission Report mentioned the 1949-1953 report of the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment. The same's primary purpose was to emphasise a death that was least painful, quick and caused the least destruction to the body.
					<br><br>
					However, death was not the only thing they improved; the French revolution also improved life. According to Jordanova (1989), there was also a medical revolution that constitutes a microcosm of the macrocosm called the French revolution and is considered a significant period for medical knowledge, which is celebrated in myth and history using two examples 'Philippe Pinel's losing of the chains of the insane' and 'the birth of the clinic'; the later meaning the rise of the Paris hospital medicine (p. 39).
					<br><br>
					The Guillotine raised the question of mind-body interaction. According to some, after Charlotte Corday d'Armont was guillotined, the crowd could see her lifeless face change expressions. Incidents like this brought anxiety about the process of death, and medical practitioners and advancements in medical technology took the centre place. Thus, it led to developments in the know-how of body and head movements after and during death. Many discoveries about external stimuli' effects on the body were made, which to this date help medical professionals understand the state of the body and act accordingly. Soemmerring explained how hanging caused a sense of sleepiness because of pressure on the blood in the brain, while Cabanis explained that the movements in the case of Charlotte were due to external stimulus acting on the exposed spinal cord. Luigi contributed by showing the movements of amputated limbs through electricity.
					<br><br>
					The French revolution brought about changes in warfare technologies. As FRANCK (2004) has written, the French military reform movement arose due to the political and societal changes during the French revolution, which included signification improvements in infantry tactics and field artillery movement. This reform helped the French come up with new formations and helped the artillery improve, which improved to such an extent under Napolean that it was highly feared. Napolean developed the strategy of surprise attack, which is to date used under the name of Guerrilla warfare.
					<br><br>
					There were other developments as well, used massively in today's world. The Metric system as we know it was proposed during the first French Revolution. After being rejected by Napolean, it was reinstated in 1940. This single event in the history of France was a turning point for the whole world. It has, to date, helped researchers share knowledge without restrictions, driving humankind forward. The Encyclopedie and the idea of knowledge being collected and classified came about due to the French revolution and, to date, helped people develop the idea of the world being 'knowable'. The use of potatoes as a concentrated food source for the army helped the French take on total warfare instead of seasonal warfare, which has given us the insight into high starch contents of potatoes. This popularity of potatoes is what gave us the recipe for modern French Fries, written in the French cookbook ‘La cuisinière républicaine’ in 1795. We earlier discussed art being a popular medium of propaganda during the revolution. This popularity and demand among the poor made the Press cheap and led to advancements in printing technology like low-cost inks.
					<br><br>
					Nevertheless, as is seen by many exchanges between scientists throughout the first French revolution, they were not spared from the political and social turmoil. Many scientists wished for peace and calmness to restore so they could return to their laboratories. As Chaptal, the founder of French industrial chemistry, wrote, "The revolution which is taking place is a beautiful thing, but I wish it had arrived twenty years ago." many were annoyed. However, some, like Lavoisier, took part in the politics of the revolution. He, in 1788, prepared a lengthy memorandum on the proper constitution of the Estates-General; in 1789, he took up a significant part in drawing up the cahier of grievances; in May, he was chosen alternate deputy to the Estates-General (Guerlac, 1955, p. 95). This was also a time, when sociology came up, idealised as philosophy of science or philosophy of social science. It was based on Condorcet’s ideas of a unified social science.
