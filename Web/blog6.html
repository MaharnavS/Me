			<h1 class="heading">Some of the expectations from the Constituent Assembly and some of the challenges it faced</h1>

					In this essay, we talk of the different confrontations faced by the Constituent Assembly while drafting the Constitution and after officially enacting it on the 26th of January, 1950. However, first, we need to understand the Constitution and what role the Constituent Assembly played in bringing it into effect. So, the Constitution of India is the highest law of India. This document lays down all the freedoms enjoyed by an individual being a citizen of India, the individual's duties towards the nation and other citizens of India, and the laws by which the individual is governed, along with directives to allow state and central machinery to modify or declare void the above. It also defines the powers of each Constitutional Institution and lays down principles for the introduction of others. The Preamble to the Constitution of India, and by extension, the Constitution of India itself, declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular and democratic republic. 
					<br><br>
					Now let us talk about the Constituent Assembly, formed in November 1946, which was elected to frame the Constitution of India. It consisted of indirectly elected representatives and later served as the first Parliament as the 'Provisional Parliament of India'. The above fact allows us to extend our discussion about challenges faced by the Constituent Assembly to the first Parliament. Being founded during the one-party reign of the Congress Party, most of the members came from the same. This domination by Congress made Nehru the first Prime Minister of India and bent the Constitution according to his will. He made several amendments to the Constitution of India during his term, some of which we shall discuss here. 
					<br><br>
					There were many expectations from the newly formed Constituent Assembly. As Congress has dreamt of socially and economically reforming India through a Constitution, people linked Congress' promises to these expectations from the Constituent Assembly. However, as soon as the first Parliament was formed and the Constitution was instated, on 8 February 1950, the Bombay High Court released the suspected communists and declared the Bombay Public Safety Measures Act void based on fundamental rights. Many laws followed, and soon the Government was forced into declaring that not all expectations could be met, and the Constitution itself was becoming a hurdle (Singh, 2020). Many such challenges were faced by the Constituent Assembly (later the first Parliament) either before enacting the Constitution or later. We will discuss some in the upcoming paragraphs.
					<br><br>
					We discuss what challenges the Constituent Assembly faced while deciding on post-British Governance. The Assembly was of the consensus that the Constitution would be utterly different from British rule and would grant extensive rights to its citizens (Singh, 2020). They started by adopting the Federal System of Governance which, according to Brass (1994), was a feature of the continuity between the Government of India Act (1935) and the Constitution of India. This continuation has led to incorporating both Fundamental Rights of the People and Directive Principles; the two combined protect the people and directives for the state machinery to introduce changes to implement the rights better. This continuation also caused much friction between the Judiciary and the then Parliament of India, as we shall see later. 
					<br><br>
					The first and foremost challenge they faced was to justify the competence of Fundamental Rights in a nation like India, where a mass of the people are impoverished and tied to backward traditions. Many believed that these rights would be put to use to protect the exploiters rather than those who were being exploited. This belief later proves to be the case when the Government tries to pass the Land Reform Act in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Many landlords and merchants signed petitions in the courts that the Act violated their rights. These petitions introduce many hurdles in Government's way to an 'economically and socially equal' India. The Constituent Assembly can be said to have foreseen this situation as it kept clauses giving the Government power to stripe the individual of its rights based on public good; specifically, the Freedom of Property was kept separate to allow for the Government to make the landlords yield. 
					<br><br>
					Another challenge for the Constituent Assembly was that, unlike in America and Britain, there was a divide based on religion and community prevalent in India. This situation, the Constituent Assembly argued, was caused by the British by introducing separate electorates. The Constituent Assembly established a single electorate, keen on socially reforming India. They enlisted the lower castes in the schedule, which gave them special privileges and enjoyed preferential policies. This enactment was done to ensure the growth of the lower castes and bring them level with others. The issue of no equality of opportunity in India was resolved by giving special provisions for reservation based on religious and communal aspects in government agencies and public institutions.
					<br><br>
					We conclude by reiterating what Brass (1994) says, that the leaders of the country at independence, i.e., the Constituent Assembly and the first Parliament, chose to retain some features of the colonial legacy. Thus the Constitution so formed was a mixture of ideas borrowed from abroad, which were then further moulded to fit in the social structure of India with due consideration given to the religious aspect as well as traditional practices. 
					<br><br>
					Nevertheless, in this journey of the formation of the Constitution, the Constituent Assembly was expected to be many things. It faced many challenges, but as Pandit Jawahar Lal says, "a C.A. does not merely mean a body of people or a gathering of able lawyers who are intent on drawing up a constitution. "It means a nation on the move, throwing away the shell of its past political and possibly social structure, and fashioning for itself a new Government of its own making."" (as cited in Alexander, 1946, p. 5), the Constituent Assembly handled the expectations and challenges, and thus today we have the Constitution.
